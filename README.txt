The Athens State University CS452 Senior Project Team assigned to the Athens-Limestone 911 Web Development Project.

This README file will explain the organization of the structure that we are using within the system.

The root folder of the web server is under /Original-Website/public_html, which is where most of the relevant files are located, and where all folder structures that begin with ~ start from.

The job application webapp is located inside ~/jobapp, with corresponding folders for css, javascript, etc.

The address request form webapp is located inside ~/addressreq, and has a similar layout to the job application folder.

All documentation (presentation, manuals, etc.) submitted for this assignment are located in /documents.
